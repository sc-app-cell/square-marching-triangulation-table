# square-marching-triangulation-table
a triangulation table to use for square marching. There are many cube marching (3d) tables but i found no pre-made 2d one so i made one on my own. I apologize for the wonky and unprofessional docs
the explanation of how the indexes and the triangolation works is in the pdf, and i also included a unity implementation
